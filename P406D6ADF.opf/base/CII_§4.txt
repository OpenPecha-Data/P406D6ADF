Whoever they were old, he was companied with them, governed and went along with them.

Even though he attained a secular profit, it was without pleasure.

He wandered in all four crossroads, verifying the disciplines of the dharmas everywhere, and
entered to the king’s repository.

At various discourses upon assembly of dharmas he suddenly came and appeared, but did not enjoy
the Hīnayāna.

To all who desire to learn he came and appeared by himself, as well as instruct and open up
ignorant children.

He entered all kinds of women’s houses but removed that desire and anger.

He entered all the drinking shops but stood firmly at his intention.
