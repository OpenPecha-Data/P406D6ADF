Even for the sake of white clothed ones, he upheld the conduct of Śramaṇas including Bhikṣus.He
had stayed in the house for the sake of practice, but was not involved in the formless
[state].He had a wife, sons, and harems, and according to his own desire always practiced
the abstinence.Even though he had family members, it was like he was always abiding in solitude.He
appeared together with [ornaments] adorning his body and clothes to wear.He had
food and drink, but inside was always like meditating.Even he played with dice and amused
himself, he was always [there] for the sake of saving people.He guided all who followed false
teachers by means of the Buddha’s teaching, never being discourteous to the scriptures.He,
although depending upon all the secular teaching in the world, spoke well with enjoyment
of the dharma and enjoyed it.He was respected by all crowds as a result of making the
foremost offering.
